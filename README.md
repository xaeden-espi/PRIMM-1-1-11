# PRIMM: 1+1 = 11?

## Predict
Answer the following questions *without running the repo**.

1. What does this program output?
    > I predict that this program will output the sum of 1+1 to equal 11

2. If the user intended on outputting the sum of two numbers, does this program accomplish the purpose? Why/why not?
    > No, because 11 is not the sum of 1+1

## Run
Run the program. 

1. What does the program output. Refer to what numbers you entered and what you got back.
    > your answer


## Investigate
1. Add a single-line comment above each major chunk of code to explain what is happening.
2. Read about the concept of [string concatenation](https://www.w3schools.com/python/gloss_python_string_concatenation.asp). Explain in your own words below what it is and how it relates to this program.

3. Read about the [`int()`](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_int.asp) and [`float()`](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_float.asp) functions in Python. What do they do? How can they help this program?
    > your answer

## Modify
1. Change the program using what you learned so that it adds two numbers you enter.
2. Try entered a non-numeric value. What happens? What kind of error is this (refer to our error types).
    > your answer

## Make
1. Add more lines of code to perform other math operations with the numbers you entered and print out the results. Try the following operators. 
    - `-`
    - `*`
    - `**`
    - `/`
    - `//`
    - `**`
    - `%`

2. Can you figure out what they do without looking them up? You might need to enter multiple numbers to figure it out. Fill in the table below.

| Operator | Meaning |
|  :---:    |   :---:   |  
|   `+`    | Addition |
|   `-`    | your answer |
|   `*`    | your answer |
|   `/`    | your answer |
|   `//`    | your answer |
|   `**`    | your answer |
|   `%`    | your answer |
